Project Proposal:
Before you start writing any code, remember that you only have one week to complete this project. View this project as a typical assignment from work. Imagine a bunch of data came in and you and your team are tasked with migrating it to a production data base. Take advantage of your Instructor and TA support during office hours and class project work time. They are a valuable resource and can help you stay on track.

Data Cleanup & Analysis , Project Report
Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:

Created database , table schema , queries via PostgresSQL / Created Database connection via PgAdmin4

The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.
Loaded DataFrames into PostgresSQL database

You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.
